# Predicting hosts and cross-species transmission of Streptococcus agalactiae by interpretable machine learning

## Highlights
●	Leveraging a genome-wide mutation-based machine learning approach to accurately pinpoint hosts of Streptococcus agalactiae.
●	Unraveling the cross-species transmission of Streptococcus agalactiae by delving into misclassified samples.
●	Uncover key features across different hosts of Streptococcus agalactiae and in cross-species transmission using interpretable machine learning techniques.
